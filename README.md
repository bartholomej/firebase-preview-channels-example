# Firebase Preview Channels Starter

> Example/Starter app for [Firebase Preview Channels](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/10/preview-channels-firebase-hosting.html) with Angular 10 Universal and Github Actions CI/CD for autodeploy

## What is inside?

- Firebase multihosting
- Firebase Preview Channels
- Angular 10
- Angular Universal (SSR)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy) for CI/CD deploy
- Typescript everywhere
- Yarn everywhere

## How it works?

### Deploy to Preview Channel on pull requests

If you create _pull request_ the action creates a new preview channel automatically.

Preview channel url format: `https://<site-name>--<channel-id>-<random-hash>.web.app`

### Deploy to your live channel on merge

If you merge pull request into `master` branch you will see your changes in production.
